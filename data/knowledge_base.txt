Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique where an AI assistant first retrieves relevant context from a knowledge base and then uses that context to answer a question.

A chatbot built with RAG usually has three core parts:
1. Document ingestion and chunking.
2. A retriever that finds relevant chunks for a user query.
3. An answer generator that writes a final response using those chunks.

Cosine similarity over TF-IDF vectors is a lightweight way to build a retriever for small or medium text collections.

When there is not enough supporting context, the chatbot should say that it does not have enough information rather than hallucinating.

You can improve answer quality by adding more documents to the knowledge base and re-indexing.
